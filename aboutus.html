      <p>Due to my own experience with my many allergies, I decided to create a website dedicated to making life with
        allergies as easy and streamlined as possible.
        The main goal of this website is to make allergy-friendly recipes as accessible as possible.
        My goal is to empower individuals with food allergies to live happy, healthy, and fulfilling lives. We believe
        that everyone deserves access to accurate and helpful information about food allergies, and we are committed to
        making that information easily accessible on our website.</p>
